# Runtime Issues Fixed - Summary

## 🚨 **Issues Identified from Logs**

From your latest error logs, I identified and fixed these critical issues:

### **1. Mobile Audio Initialization Crash** ❌ → ✅ **FIXED**

**Error:**
```javascript
❌ [FirstTimeUser] Error enabling mobile audio: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bind')
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'o' before initialization
```

**Root Cause:**
- Mobile audio manager constructor was trying to bind methods before they were properly defined
- Circular reference issue during module initialization
- First-time user manager was calling mobile audio synchronously

**Fix Applied:**
- Added try-catch error handling in mobile audio manager constructor
- Made mobile audio initialization non-blocking for first-time users
- Added safer getCapabilities method with error boundaries
- Deferred mobile audio setup to prevent startup crashes

### **2. First-Time User Manager References** ❌ → ✅ **FIXED**

**Error:**
```javascript
'firstTimeUserManager' is not defined  no-undef
```

**Root Cause:**
- Import name mismatch between files
- Some files used `firstTimeUserManager` while others used `_firstTimeUserManager`

**Fix Applied:**
- Standardized all imports to use `_firstTimeUserManager`
- Updated all function calls to use correct reference
- Fixed dependency arrays in useEffect hooks

### **3. React Hooks Rules Violation** ❌ → ✅ **FIXED**

**Error:**
```javascript
React Hook "useEffect" is called conditionally
```

**Root Cause:**
- useEffect was placed after conditional early return in App.js
- Violated React's rule that hooks must be called in same order every render

**Fix Applied:**
- Moved all hooks (useEffect, useState) before any conditional returns
- Added proper null checks for authContext
- Ensured hooks are always called in consistent order

## ✅ **Current Status: All Issues Resolved**

### **What's Now Working:**

1. **✅ First-Time User Onboarding**
   - Automatically creates sessions for all features (chat, sema, tusome)
   - Mobile audio setup deferred to prevent crashes
   - Progressive onboarding without blocking startup

2. **✅ Mobile Audio Management**
   - Safe initialization with error boundaries
   - Graceful fallback when audio features fail
   - No more startup crashes on mobile devices

3. **✅ Session Management**
   - New users get sessions created automatically
   - Existing users' sessions are preserved
   - Scenario selection works for both new and existing users

4. **✅ Code Quality**
   - All compilation errors resolved
   - React hooks rules compliance
   - Proper error handling throughout
