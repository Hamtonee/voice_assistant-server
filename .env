# ===========================================
# React App Environment Configuration
# ===========================================

# ⚠️  REQUIRED: Base URL for the Express/Prisma API
# This is the main API endpoint that all components will use
# The application will NOT work without this variable!
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.100.122:5000/api

# Alternative configurations for different environments:
# For local development:
# REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# For production deployment:
# REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# ===========================================
# SECURE React App Environment Configuration
# ===========================================
# 
# ⚠️  CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE:
# This configuration removes all hardcoded URLs from the application
# and implements proper environment variable validation for security.
#
# All API endpoints must be configured here - the app will NOT start
# without these variables being properly set.

# ===========================================
# ⚠️  REQUIRED API ENDPOINTS
# ===========================================
# The application will crash on startup if any of these are missing!

# ===========================================
# SECURITY BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH
# ===========================================
#
# 1. ✅ NO HARDCODED URLS: All endpoints are configurable
# 2. ✅ STARTUP VALIDATION: App crashes if endpoints are missing
# 3. ✅ ENVIRONMENT FLEXIBILITY: Easy switching between dev/staging/prod
# 4. ✅ VERSION CONTROL SAFE: No sensitive URLs committed to git
# 5. ✅ DEPLOYMENT READY: Environment-specific configurations
# 6. ✅ ERROR PREVENTION: Clear error messages for missing config
# 7. ✅ MAINTAINABILITY: Single source of truth for all endpoints

# ===========================================
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
# ===========================================
#
# 1. Copy this file to your React app root directory as ".env"
# 2. Update all endpoint URLs to match your backend server
# 3. Restart your React development server after making changes
# 4. Verify all endpoints are accessible before running the app
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: The app will refuse to start if any endpoint is missing!

# ===========================================
# NETWORK CONFIGURATION GUIDE
# ===========================================
#
# For localhost development:
# - Use http://localhost:8000 for local development
# - Ensure your backend server is running on port 8000
#
# For network access (mobile devices, other computers):
# - Find your IP address: ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Mac/Linux)
# - Replace localhost with your IP (e.g., 192.168.100.122)
# - Ensure firewall allows connections on port 8000
# - Make sure both devices are on the same network
#
# For production deployment:
# - Use HTTPS endpoints (https://)
# - Point to your production server domain
# - Ensure proper SSL certificates are configured

# ===========================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ===========================================
#
# If you get "Missing required environment variables" error:
# 1. Check that all REACT_APP_*_ENDPOINT variables are set
# 2. Verify there are no typos in variable names
# 3. Restart your React development server
# 4. Check the browser console for specific missing variables
#
# If you get connection errors:
# 1. Verify backend server is running on specified host/port
# 2. Test endpoints directly in browser (e.g., http://localhost:8000/health)
# 3. Check firewall settings for non-localhost addresses
# 4. Ensure CORS is properly configured on your backend
#
# For mobile testing:
# 1. Use your computer's IP address instead of localhost
# 2. Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network
# 3. Check that mobile device can ping your computer's IP

# ===========================================
# DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
# ===========================================
#
# For different deployment environments, consider:
#
# 1. Create environment-specific .env files:
#    - .env.development (for local development)
#    - .env.staging (for staging server)
#    - .env.production (for production server)
#
# 2. Use build-time environment variables for static deployments
#
# 3. For containerized deployments (Docker):
#    - Pass environment variables through docker-compose.yml
#    - Or use Docker secrets for sensitive configurations
#
# 4. For cloud deployments (Vercel, Netlify, AWS):
#    - Set environment variables in the deployment platform
#    - Use the platform's environment variable management
#
# 5. Never commit .env files with production URLs to version control

# ===========================================
# VERSION CONTROL SETUP
# ===========================================
#
# Add to your .gitignore file:
# .env
# .env.local
# .env.development.local
# .env.test.local
# .env.production.local
#
# Consider providing a .env.example file with placeholder values:
# REACT_APP_SPEECH_COACH_ENDPOINT=https://your-backend-server.com/speech-coach
# REACT_APP_DEEPSPEAK_ENDPOINT=https://your-backend-server.com/deepspeak-tts
# # ... etc

# ===========================================
# MIGRATION FROM OLD CONFIGURATION
# ===========================================
#
# If migrating from the old REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL approach:
#
# OLD (DEPRECATED):
# REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
#
# NEW (SECURE):
# REACT_APP_SPEECH_COACH_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/speech-coach
# REACT_APP_DEEPSPEAK_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/deepspeak-tts
# # ... all other individual endpoints
#
# Benefits of the new approach:
# - More granular control over each service
# - Better error handling for missing endpoints
# - Easier to configure different services on different servers
# - More secure and maintainable
